We learned about operators, including arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, increment operators, logical operators, string operators, and array operators. We also studied conditional statements, such as the if statement, if–else statement, if–elif–else statement, nested if statements, and the switch statement. In addition, we covered loops, specifically the while loop and the for loop, which are used to execute code repeatedly under certain conditions.
